### 06-2025.05.22 â€“ Lessons 17 & 18 (Improved)  [View Folder](./06-2025.05.22)
Refactored the code from folder `05_2025.05.21`.  
Put the class in a header file, defined the functions in a `.cpp` file, and used `main.cpp` to run the program.  
This was my first time using `ClassName::Function()` to define class methods outside the class.
