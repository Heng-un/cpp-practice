06_2025.05.21 Practice After The Cherno C++ Series - Lessons 17 & 18_reference & class  
I improved the code from folder 05_2025.05.21.  
I put the class in a header file, defined the functions in a .cpp file, and used main.cpp to run the program.
This is my first time using ClassName::Function() to define functions outside the class.
