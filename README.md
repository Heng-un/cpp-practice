##  Practice List

### `01_2025.05.08` â€“ Lessons 09 & 10: *Functions & Header Files*
Practiced how to use functions and organize code using header files.

---

### `02_2025.05.10` â€“ Lesson 12: *If Statements*
Made a very simple game using `if` statements.

---

### `03_2025.05.18` â€“ Lesson 14: *For & While Loops*
Another simple game using loops.

### `04_2025.05.21` â€“ Lesson 16: *Pointers*
Practiced using pointers and double pointers.  
Also learned how to delete dangling pointers properly.

---

### `05_2025.05.21` â€“ Lessons 17 & 18: *References & Classes*
Used `class` and `reference` to create a simple system.  
Also used `if` statements and loops from earlier lessons.

---

### `06_2025.05.21` â€“ Lessons 17 & 18 (Improved)
Refactored the code from folder `05_2025.05.21`.  
Put the class in a header file, defined the functions in a `.cpp` file, and used `main.cpp` to run the program.  
This was my first time using `ClassName::Function()` to define class methods outside the class.
