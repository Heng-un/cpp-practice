## ðŸ“‚ Practice List

### 01-2025.05.08 â€“ Lessons 09 & 10: *Functions & Header Files*  [View Folder](./01-2025.05.08)
Practiced how to use functions and organize code using header files.

---

### 02-2025.05.10 â€“ Lesson 12: *If Statements*  [View Folder](./02-2025.05.10)
Made a very simple game using `if` statements.

### 04-2025.05.21 â€“ Lesson 16: *Pointers*  [View Folder](./04-2025.05.21)
Practiced using pointers and double pointers.

### 05-2025.05.22 â€“ Lessons 17 & 18: *References & Classes*  [View Folder](./05-2025.05.22)
Used `class` and `reference` to create a simple system.

---

### 06-2025.05.22 â€“ Lessons 17 & 18 (Improved)  [View Folder](./06-2025.05.22)
Put the class in a header file, defined the functions in a `.cpp` file, and used `main.cpp` to run the program.  
This was my first time using `ClassName::Function()` to define class methods outside the class.

---  

### 07-2025.05.24 â€“ Lessons 22 (Static)  [View Folder](./07-2025.05.24)
After learning about `static`, I wrote a simple class and tried defining methods outside the class.

### 08-2025.06.01 â€“ Lessons 22 (enum)  [View Folder](./08-2025.06.01)
After learning about `enums`, I practiced based on The Cherno's tutorial.
Used static functions without creating an instance.

### 09-2025.06.01 â€“ Lessons 22 (constructors)  [View Folder](./09-2025.06.01)
A small exercise I wrote after learning about `constructors`.
